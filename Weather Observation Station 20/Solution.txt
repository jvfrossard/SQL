In Oracle is very simple, because the median function

SELECT ROUND(MEDIAN(Lat_N), 4)
FROM Station;


In MySQL it is much harder, because we don't have a median function

SELECT ROUND(S.lat_n,4) 
FROM Station AS S 
WHERE 
    (SELECT ROUND(COUNT(S.id)/2)-1 
     FROM Station) = 
        (SELECT COUNT(s1.id) 
         FROM Station AS S1 
         WHERE S1.Lat_n > S.Lat_n);
